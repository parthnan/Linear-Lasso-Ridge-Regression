# Linear-Lasso-Ridge-Regression
Covers everything from data handling and linear regression, up to Lasso and Ridge (L1 and L2). The aim of both, the visualization and the Multivariate regression is to predict sales of an Ice cream product on each day of the year 2012. The learning dataset is the same as the testing dataset(which doesnt hurt the learning in regression methods anyway!). Doesn't Require prerequisite knowledge. 

# Topics Covered

1. Reading and Visualizing data using simple graphs

2. Visualizing covariance between parameters using Seaborn. Example: pairplot function(below), matplotlib(below), heatmap etc.

3. Prediction of Ice cream Sales data using Linear,Lasso and Ridge Regression (using Scikit-Learn). Example: Prediction using Lasso Normalization was as below.
