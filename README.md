# Linear-Lasso-Ridge-Regression
A tutorial in Japanese starting from data handling and linear regression, all the way up to Lasso and Ridge Normalization. Doesn't Require prerequisite knowledge. The aim is to predict sales of an Ice cream product on each day od the year using Multivariate Regression. 

# Topics Covered

1. Reading and Visualizing data using simple graphs

2. Visualizing covariance between parameters using Seaborn. Example: pairplot function(below), matplotlib(below), heatmap etc.
